//Registers the schema as a Mongoose model named "User".
//You can now use User elsewhere to create, read, update, and delete user documents.

//SALT ROUNDS
//What Is a Salt?
// A salt is random data added to a password before it‚Äôs hashed.
// Purpose: To prevent two identical passwords from having the same hash.
// Result: Even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different.

// üîÅ What Are Salt Rounds?
// Salt rounds determine how many times the hashing algorithm is applied (or how complex it is).
// bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
// The number 10 is the number of salt rounds (also called cost factor).
// It means: "Perform the hashing algorithm 2¬π‚Å∞ (1024) times internally."
//10 is a balanced default ‚Äî secure but not too slow.
//Higher values increase security but may slow down your app if you have many logins.
